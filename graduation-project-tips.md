# Ten Things they don't tell you about your graduation project

In this document, you'll find the most important tips and tricks learned through my senior year in the hopes of helping you and all future CCEians to have a great experience with the graduation project and how to get the most out of it (fingers crossed ).

## Tip #1: Team Comes First :two_men_holding_hands:

The team is the **most important factor** of any project, a team determines how the project starts, how the project ends and pretty much everything in between. 
You must be comfortable to be yourself with your team, while being professional about it at the same time. That means, you have to learn to respect your teammates, listen to them and have civilized discussions about your team decisions. 

Working with a team for a long time in general strengths your non technical skills that includes but not limited to communication skills, brainstorming and ownership. Working with new people with different mindsets than yours can be challenging, though it can be an enriching experience that you learn a lot from so don't be afraid of that, just choose wisely. 

So, the number one step is to gather the team of friends/superheroes you want to roll with. Those who you're ready to partner up with for a one-year contract project. 

## Tip #2: Brainstorming Ideas :bulb:

So, now you have a team that is ready to take on this challenge. **What next?**  
Start of with couple of meetings, to brainstorm ideas for the project. I always get the question of how to find ideas, and you must understand that there are no clear steps or a roadmap you follow for that question.

Instead, what I propose to you some questions that by answering them yourselves, you will have a more clear view of where your idea is going:

- What is the **focus/direction** of the project:question: Is it a research-based project or is it product-based project:question:  

- What **technical fields of study** your project is tackling:question: Is it an embedded system project or a web/mobile based project:question:

- What are the **hot topics in that field of study** we're tackling:question: What problems are related to that field in general:question:  

- What **technology stacks/fields** your team collectively have of knowledge of:question: What new technology stacks/fields are you required to learn:question:

Try to answer those questions, they will narrow down your search space at least. You can lookup startup ideas that have previously explored that domain before and find something similar interesting to you.

Also, keep in mind, your idea need not be a fresh idea. You can choose to re-create an already existing solution in a better fashion/ with new fancy features than those done in the field (Consider as an example, Careem company's success story while Uber was already there).

As a final note here, bring up more than one idea (one at least as backup plan) in case professors don't find this idea attractive enough for them, you should have other options in your bag.

## Tip #3: Contact Suitable Supervisiors :email:

We are making progress, you now have a team, and a bag of ideas (couple of ones can be enough as well) that you are ready propose to someone. Next step is to find professors that are both interested in the fields of study you are going to tackle, and interested in your specific idea. 

A problem is that our university doesn't support us with a list of professors with fields they are interested in/worked with before. A current solution until such list is ready for us either through university or students efforts, is for you to use some connections and ask graduates about their supervisors and decide which professors can help you the most.

When you're done with the search, be prepared for you have to write an idea proposal to send in the email to professors. An idea proposal can range from 2-3 paragraphs where you just propose the solid core idea in simple terms, no need for fancy stuff here. Also, keep in mind that some professors expect strong proposals and clear ideas from the get go and other are willing to brainstorm together.


## Tip #4: Plan Wisely :hourglass_flowing_sand:

The real work starts from here ! A mistake a lot make is to follow random patterns when working with no clear idea of what they're going to finish in how much time or deadlines whatsoever. (Be smart, don't do that) To avoid that mess:

- You should use a proper **software methodology** for project planning (recommending **Agile/Scrum** because that's what you're probably gonna use in work) and software life-cycle planning. And if you're not aware what are those, don't worry there are lot of guides & material that are two clicks away from a Google search on those topics.

- Second tip here is to use a **software that manages your project tasks/backlog**, most famous options for this are **[JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)**, and **[Trello Boards](https://trello.com/)**. Those software tools will help bump your productivity and keep you organized throughout the year of hard work. Knowledge of such tools will be a great qualification for work later on, since not all graduates learn about these stuff before they actually start working.

- Third tip for a well managed project is to learn how to **estimate time needed for tasks** you work on before you actually work on it. Evaluate how well your estimate was comapred to the actual time and keep re-iterating and improving the delta between them. Task time estimation is yet but another skill you'll use a lot in work.

- Last, but not least, set how many hours you and your team can give the project per week and commit to them. A good way to commit to time can be using a time tracking software but that can a bit extreme as well. Ideally, 3-4 hours a day accumulating to almost 20 hours a week is fine.

## Tip #5: Learning Before Everything :books:

This one is important because it's easy to forget actually I did myself and needed someone to remind me with it each time. The graduation project is your learning environment, it's analogous to a university course that you put it's content/assignments and study it well. Some tips that can help through your learning journey are:

- **Don't** *just pick technology stacks because you're already familiar with*. If there's a stack that is new to you and is a better choice, you should take the chance and learn it.

- **Don't** *rush tasks*, take your time (whatever available) and perfect each task you work on. If a task requires more time to learn that new thing you just got introduced to, ask for more available time.

- **Don't** *overengineer your solutions*, an important principal to learn called KISS "Keep It Simple Stupid", states that you should always keep it simple as much as you can. **Overengineering** solutions is a common mistake between software engineers. (no shame in that)

- **Do** *solutions comparison study*, whenever you face a technical problem don't just take the first solution you find. Maybe it's the best one and maybe there are better ones you didn't explore yet. For each solution, write a pros vs cons table and choose the best fit to all factors given to you.

- **Do** *code peer reviewing*, one of the best ways to learn and get better is to exchange the experience and knowledge and it also ensures code quality.

- **Do** *knowledge exchange sessions* with each other every now and then to sync everyone's knowledge especially if you're organized as sub-teams. For example, an Android sub-team can give some insights to the backend sub-team and vice-versa.

## Tip #6: Document Everything (literally) :pencil2:

You'll probably want to document everything that happens in the project life-time. It's a one-year project, don't expect to never forget stuff, on the contrary, you'll always forget details especially finer ones. So, what to document ?

- **Requirements Analysis:** and project-planning details. All those sketches, sticky notes and silly drawings can matter later.
- **Meeting Notes:** Supervisor notes in each meeting with him/her. Always be prepared in meetings with a pen and paper/ or a laptop with a note app.
- **Brainstorming Sessions:** What were the ideas proposed? How did you reach an agreement on something? Why was this idea discarded?
- **Links/resources:** Everything you find along the way can be valuable. Psst..Bugs do re-appear :beetle:.

## Tip #7: Manage Code Smartly :octocat:

If you didn't use Git (or any other version control system) and Github (or any other remote repositories system) till your senior year for any reason, now is the time. It's probably a must to manage the project's code using a version control tool as Git alongside remote hosting as Github (my favorite options although others exist).

Use a clean **git branching model** to work with. I recommend looking [here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for more details and insights on clean git usage and git tips

## Tip #8: Use Your Academic Email :office:

Everyone forgets the precious treasure lying in their hands until they lose it. :dollar:  
If you have an academic email, you get free access to a lot of software tools that can be very beneficial for your graduation project. 

The biggest gains come from the awesome **[Github Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)**. If any of the team members don't have such an email, I highly advise him/her to go get one asap because you'll want to use it.

## Tip #9: Always Think Big ! :dart:

Take this project seriously, effort is appreciated and speaks for itself. This is really a big and good opportunity to build a great project and learn a lot from. Also, it's a great chance to be unique and stand out from your peers since everyone almost has same college projects, so this can be a game changer in your resume.

## Tip #10: Have Fun ! :tada:

This is the last year in your Bachelor's degree (this should be significant), enjoy, have fun with your team. Don't make it ruin your time, or stress you out instead make it flourish it and add memories to it. Having fun is equivalently important to working hard !
